# Marlo's Reflection

1. **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session**

The idea of a merge conflict was diffeicult to grasp. I still feel like I have some blockages when it comes to thinking about these concepts, but I feel like they will come with more hands-on practice.

2.  **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

Merging pull requests, and viewing the changes on GitHub. 

3. **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

I asked my pair about creating branches off of other branches. I asked my guide about using the term "origin"as opposed to using the URL of the remote repository.

4. **What still confuses you about Git?**

We were not able get the fetch and merge section to work in git-bash. We had to resort to using pull instead. I would like to learn about why this was the case.

Also, the image in **awesome_page.md** did not show up correctly, and I wonder if we have linked in incorrectly.

5. **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

It is excellent to have a guide to help you through the difficult blocks. Because the assignment gets more difficult toward the end (when we are least likely to have a guide still with us due to time constraints), it can be difficult to move forward with/complete your work.
